 - Description: 
     Birth Rates, 
     per capita income, 
     proportion (ratio?) of population in farming, 
     and infant mortality
     during early 1950s for 30 nations.

 - Conclusion:
     In that period of time, the biggest impact on birth rate had the
     proportion of population in farming which is excpected result knowing
     history of that time. Slightly less influence had infant mortality, and
     per capita income had almost none of the impact (which is, one could say, 
     a surprising result knowing nowadays situation).
